jn 0.3.4
by Ben Winston (winsbe01@gmail.com)

A simple command-line journal tool.

REQUIREMENTS:
 - awk (for search)
 - any text editor set in $EDITOR

TO INSTALL:
 - copy jn into a folder in your path, e.g., $HOME/bin if that is part of $PATH, and make executable

TO RUN:
 - run 'jn' or 'jn -u' and you will be brought into the editor you chose to make your entry
	you@your-machine~$ jn
 - for help, type 'jn -h'
 - to search the journal, type jn -s [term1] [term2]
 - to browse the whole journal, type 'jn -b'

CHANGELOG:
0.3.4:
- fixed search with only one term

0.3.3:
- alternate XDG support
- removed need for jninstaller

0.3.2:
- removed less
- implemented search using awk

0.3.1:
 - BUGFIX: in jninstaller, changed "JNEDITOR='$jneditor'" to "export JNEDITOR='$jneditor'"

0.3:
 - added browsing feature to view the entire journal
 - now using a user-chosen editor to fill out the journal, instead of reading from stdin
 - removed a "search" feature -> will be implemented in a future version, but the first version was too simplistic to be useful

TODO:
 - figure out how to get it so new installs won't have to run 'source .bashrc'
